# yueplushart
This repository contains the code for YuePlush's portfolio website. The site
uses simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript to present artwork samples, commission
information and links to social media.

When visitors select **Suggestive Art** they will first be asked to confirm
they are adults. After confirming, subcategories such as Bubbles, Balloons,
Pooltoy and Other become available. No suggestive artwork is shown until one of
these subcategories is chosen.
